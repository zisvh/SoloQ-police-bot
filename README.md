## DISCLAIMER

* I don't consider myself good at coding, in fact this script is really not optimized, but at least it works. (if you can help me make it cleaner/better PM me)
* **Why did you create this bot ?** As a coach I feel like a lot of the time players are slacking in soloQ. And I cba'd counting every players games everyday on opgg, now I can do that with a simple command.
* **How did you create this bot ?** Using really basic League API & Python knowledge.
* **Who are you** ? I am Aries, coach for Team Oplon in the LFL

# Installation (if you know Python/League API)💻:

1) From the Discord developer website, create an application & a bot, follow this tutorial: https://betterprogramming.pub/coding-a-discord-bot-with-python-64da9d6cade7
2) Clone this repository.
3) Once your discord bot is loaded on your Team server, here are things that you need to modify in our python script:
-The API KEY (modify at line 11)
-The five puuid's of your players (modify at line 23 to 27)
-The token of your discord bot (modify at line 93 -last line)

# Installation (if you **don't know** Python/League API)❌:

Well, here is the sad part, if you don't know anything about python or programming in general it will be hard for you to set this up yourself, **HOWEVER**, if you are from an ERL team I am willing to help you set it up for your team.

You can DM me right here, and I will try to help you: Aries#7475

## USE THE BOT:

After setting up the script, everything is pretty straight forward in terms of usage:

1) Once you made sure your API Key is refreshed, launch your python script using this command:
    `python3 bot.py [day/week/two]`

(use day for 'day' argument for last 24 hours, 'two' for 48 hours, and 'week' for last 7 days)

2) After this command, you should see an outpout similar to this one:

3) Now, simply go to your discord and type `!soloQ` (respect caps)
